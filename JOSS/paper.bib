abstract = {The World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) is an international community-based initiative to acquire and disseminate climate relevant data on the physical geographies of cities for modeling and analysis purposes. The current lacuna of globally consistent information on cities is a major impediment to urban climate science toward informing and developing climate mitigation and adaptation strategies at urban scales. WUDAPT consists of a database and a portal system; its database is structured into a hierarchy representing different levels of detail, and the data are acquired using innovative protocols that utilize crowdsourcing approaches, Geowiki tools, freely accessible data, and building typology archetypes. The base level of information (L0) consists of local climate zone (LCZ) maps of cities; each LCZ category is associated with a range of values for model-relevant surface descriptors (roughness, impervious surface cover, roof area, building heights, etc.). Levels 1 (L1) and 2 (L2) will provide specific intra-urban values for other relevant descriptors at greater precision, such as data morphological forms, material composition data, and energy usage. This article describes the status of the WUDAPT project and demonstrates its potential value using observations and models. As a community-based project, other researchers are encouraged to participate to help create a global urban database of value to urban climate scientists.},

@article{Brousse:2016,
abstract = {Nowadays, the absence of suitable data that describes the urban landscape in climate relevant terms for climatic models is a significant impediment to progress, even if the physics that underpins these models is universal. To address this data gap the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) project focuses on creating a global database on cities suited for urban climate studies. The first phase of WUDAPT has established a protocol using the Local Climate Zones classification system to partition the urban landscape of cities into neighbourhood types that can inform parameter selection in model applications. In this paper, we explore the potential of these data for use in the application of the Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) model, which incorporates Building Effect Parameterization and Building Energy Model (BEP-BEM) schemes. The test is conducted for Madrid (Spain) during winter and summer and the results of using LCZ derived data are compared with those using CORINE land-cover data. The results are indicative but show that the LCZ scheme improves model performance. The paper emphasizes the need for further work to extend the value of these models for decisions on urban planning. However, such work will need useful urban data to make progress.},

# Summary
An important objective of WUDAPT, the World Urban Database and Acces Portals Tools community project, is to 1) to acquire and make accessible coherent and consistent information on form and function of urban morphology relevant to climate weather, and environment studies, and 2) to provide tools that extract relevant urban parameters and properties for models and model applications at appropriate scales for various climate, weather, environment, and urban planning purposes [@Ching2018, @Ching2019]. 

The Python-based WUDAPT-to-WRF (`W2W`) package is developed in this context, and translates Local Climate Zone (LCZ) maps into urban canopy parameters readable by WRF, the community "Weather Research and Forecasting" model. It is the successor of the Fortran-based `W2W` package developed by @Brousse2016 and @Martilli2016, and provides a more simple, efficient and improved procedure to use LCZ information in WRF.   

# Statement of need
Since the pioneering work of @Brousse2016 and @Martilli2016, the level-0 WUDAPT information, the Local Climate Zone maps, have been used increasingly in WRF. We expect this trend to continue, because of two recent developments: 1) the creation of city-wide LCZ maps is now easier than ever with the launch of the online LCZ Generator [@Demuzere2021], and 2) the new version 4.3 of WRF [@Skamarock2021] is able to ingest 10 or 11 built classses (corresponding to WUDAPT's LCZs) by default, whereas previous versions required manual WRF code changes (see @Martilli2016, @Zonato2021a and @Zonato2021b for more information). 

Because of these developments, we decided to design an improved, Python-based, WUDAPT-to-WRF (`W2W`) routine, to make the translation of LCZ-based parameters better and more simple. 

# Initial data requirements
In order to use the tool, two input files are required: 

1. A **geo_em.d0X** (.nc) file for the inner WRF model domain in which one would like to use the LCZ-based information. This file can be produced by WRF's geogrid.exe tool as part of the WRF Preprocessing System (WPS). **@ANDREA: does a user needs to use specific settings here to create this file?? Please extend this section if needed.** 

2.  A **Local Climate Zone map** (.tif) file that is slightly bigger than the domain extent of the geo_em.d0X.nc file. There are a number of ways to obtain an LCZ map for your region of interest (ROI): 

   * Extract your ROI from the continental-scale LCZ maps for Europe [@Demuzere2019] or the United States [@Demuzere2020] (see [here](https://www.wudapt.org/lcz-maps/) for more info).
   * Check if your ROI is already covered by the many LCZ maps available in the [submission table](https://lcz-generator.rub.de/submissions) of the LCZ Generator.
   * Use the [LCZ Generator](https://lcz-generator.rub.de/) to make an LCZ map for your ROI. See also [here](https://www.wudapt.org/create-lcz-classification/) for more information.


# Workflow
The goal of the Python-based `W2W` tool is to obtain a WRF domain file (*geo_em.d0X.nc*) that contains the built LCZ classes and their corresponding urban canopy parameters relevant for all urban parameterizations embedded in WRF: the single layer urban canopy model Noah/SLUCM (@Kusaka2001), the Building Environment Parameterization (BEP, @Martilli2002), and BEP+BEM (Building Energy Model, @Salamanca2010). 

To get to that point, a number of sequential steps are followed:

* _Step 1: Remove the default urban land cover_

The default urban land cover from MODIS is replaced with the dominant surrounding vegetation category, as is done in @Li2020. This procedure affects WRF's parameters LU_INDEX, LANDUSEF and GREENFRAC. LU_INDEX is selected as the dominant category from the $nlus$ (default = 45) nearest grid points (excluding ocean, urban and lakes). LANDUSEF and GREENFRAC are calculated as the mean over all grid points with that category among the $nlus$ nearest points. **@DANIEL: CORRECT??**

Resulting output: **geo_em.d0X_NoUrban.nc**

* _Step 2: Define the LCZ-based urban extent_

LCZ-based impervious fraction values (FRC_URB2D, available from `LCZ_UCP_default.csv`) are assigned to the original 100 m resolution LCZ map, and are aggregated to the WRF resolution. Areas with FRC_URB2D < 0.2 ($frc$) are currently considered non-urban **@ANDREA - ADD SMALL SENTENCE TO STATE WHY THAT IS**. The FRC_URB2D field is also used to mask all other urban parameter fields, so that their extent is consistent.

Resulting output: **geo_em.d0X_LCZ_extent.nc**

* _Step 3: Introduce modal built LCZ classes_

For each WRF grid cell, the mode of the underlying built LCZ classes is added to LU_INDEX (numbered from 31-41). See [here](https://ral.ucar.edu/sites/default/files/public/product-tool/urban-canopy-model/WRF_urban_update_Readme_file_WRF4.3.pdf) for more info. Note that the `W2W` routine by default considers LCZ classes 1-10 as built classes ($bc$). Sometimes, also LCZ E (or 15 - Bare rock or paved) can be considered as a built LCZ classes, as it might reflect large asphalt surfaces such as big parking lots or airstrips. In that case, make sure to set the $bc$ argument appropriately.

* _Step 4: Assign urban canopy parameters_

Two pathways are followed when assigning the various urban canopy parameters to the LCZ Map, and translating this information onto WRF's grid:

**Pathway 1**: **Morphological parameters** are assigned directly to the high-resolution LCZ map, and are afterwards aggregated to the lower-resolution WRF grid. In this way, the method produces a unique urban morphology parameter value for each WRF grid cell. This was found to be more efficient in reproducing urban boundary layer features, especially in the outskirts of the city [@Zonato2020], and is in line with the [WUDAPT-to-COSMO](https://github.com/matthiasdemuzere/WUDAPT-to-COSMO) routine [@Varentsov2020].

Morphological urban canopy parameter values are provided in `LCZ_UCP_default.csv`, and are generally based on values provided in @Stewart2012 and @Stewart2014. In addition:

* Building width (BW), available in `LCZ_UCP_default.csv`, is taken from `URBPARM_LCZ.TBL` (stored in WRF's run/ folder). 
* While `URBPARM_LCZ.TBL` also has values on street width, `W2W` derives street width from the mean building height (MH_URB2D) and the Height-to-Width ratio (H2W), to have these fields consistent.
* Plan (LP_URB2D), frontal (LF_URB2D) and total (LB_URB2D) area indices are based on formulas in @Zonato2020.
* HI_URB2D is obtained by fitting a bounded normal distribution to the minimum (MH_URB2D_MIN), mean (MH_URB2D), and maximum (MH_URB2D_MAX) of the building heights, as provided in `LCZ_UCP_default.csv`. The building height standard deviation is also required, and is approximated as ${(MH_URB2D_MAX - MH_URB2D_MIN) / 4}$. 
* For computational efficiency, HI_URB2D values lower than 5% were set to 0 after resampling, the remaining HI_URB2D percentages are re-scaled to 100%.


**Pathway 2**: In line with the former Fortran-based `W2W` procedure, **radiative and thermal parameters** are assigned to the modal LCZ class that is assigned to each WRF grid cell. These parameter values are not stored in the netcdf output, but are read from `URBPARM_LCZ.TBL` and assigned automatically to the modal LCZ class when running the model. 


* _Step 5: Adjust global attributes_

In a final step, some global attributes are adjusted in the resulting netcdf files:

* NBUI_MAX is added as a global attribute in the netcdf file, reflecting the maximum amount of HI_URB2D classes that are not 0 across the model domain. This paramater can be used when compiling WRF, to optimize memory storage.
* NUM_LAND_CAT is set to 41, to reflect the addition of 10 (or 11) built LCZ classes. This is not only done for the highest resolution domain file, but also for **all of its parent domain files**. As such, make sure these files are also available in the input data directory. 

Resulting output: **geo_em.d0X_LCZ_params.nc**


# Potential use cases


# Important notes
* The LCZ-based urban canopy parameter values provided in `LCZ_UCP_default.csv` and `URBPARM_LCZ.TBL` are universal and generic, and might not be appropriate for your region of interest (ROI). If available, please adjust the values according to the characteristics of your ROI.
* It is advised to use this tool with urban parameterization options BEP or BEP+BEM (`sf_urban_physics = 2 or 3`). In case you use this tool with the SLUCM model (`sf_urban_physics = 1`), make sure your lowest model level is above the highest building height. If not, real.exe will provide the following error message: `ZDC + Z0C + 2m is larger than the 1st WRF level - Stop in subroutine urban - change ZDC and Z0C`
